# Regex - Matching an Email

Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex, are powerful tools used for pattern matching and manipulation of text. \
They provide a concise and flexible way to search, extract, and replace specific strings within a larger body of text. \
Regular expressions are widely used in programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools to perform tasks such as data validation, parsing, and text processing.

## Summary

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ \

The above code snippet is a regex, or regular expression, for matching an email. \
An email regex is a pattern designed to match and validate email addresses.\

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are special characters used in regular expressions to match specific positions within the text. \
They do not match any actual characters themselves but rather represent positions relative to the text. \
In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), the following anchors are used:

^ (caret) is the start anchor and represents the beginning of a line or string. \
It ensures that the regex pattern starts matching from the beginning of the text.

$ (dollar sign) is the end anchor and represents the end of a line or string. \
It ensures that the regex pattern matches all the way to the end of the text.

By using both the start and end anchors (^ and $), the email regex ensures that the entire string is matched, from start to end, without allowing any extraneous characters before or after the email address.

Anchors are useful for ensuring that a pattern matches exactly where you want it to within the text and can be applied in various scenarios beyond email validation.



### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are special characters in regular expressions that specify the number of occurrences or repetitions of the preceding element.
They control the matching behavior of a pattern by indicating whether an element should be matched once, multiple times, or in a specific range.
In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), the following quantifiers are used:

+ (plus sign) is a quantifier that matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
+ In this regex, it is used after character classes like [a-z0-9_\.-] and [\da-z\.-] to allow for multiple characters within the username and domain name.

{2,6} is a quantifier that matches a range of occurrences of the preceding element.
In this regex, it is used after [a-z\.] to specify that the TLD should consist of at least 2 characters and up to 6 characters.
This helps to accommodate common TLDs like .com, .org, or .net.

Quantifiers provide flexibility in specifying the number of repetitions in a pattern, allowing you to match varying lengths of text.
Other commonly used quantifiers include * (asterisk), which matches zero or more occurrences, and ? (question mark), which matches zero or one occurrence.


### OR Operator
The OR operator, represented by the | (pipe) character in regular expressions, allows you to specify multiple alternative patterns.
It matches either the pattern on the left or the pattern on the right. This operator helps to define choices within a regular expression.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), the OR operator is not explicitly used.

However, let's consider an example where the OR operator could be applied. Suppose you want to match either "color" or "colour" within a text.
The regex pattern would be colo(u)r, where (u) within parentheses signifies the optional "u" character.
It matches either "color" or "colour" due to the OR operator.

The OR operator is useful for situations where there are multiple valid alternatives for a pattern.
By using it, you can construct regex patterns that accommodate different variations of a specific element.


### Character Classes
Character classes, also known as character sets or character ranges, allow you to specify a group or range of characters that can be matched at a particular position in a regular expression.
They are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and provide a way to define a set of valid characters for matching.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), character classes are used to define valid characters for different parts of the email address:

[a-z0-9_\.-] matches any lowercase letter (a-z), digit (0-9), underscore (_), period (.), or hyphen (-). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the username part of the email address.

[\da-z\.-] matches any digit (\d is a shorthand for digits), lowercase letter (a-z), period (.), or hyphen (-). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the domain name part of the email address.

[a-z\.] matches any lowercase letter (a-z) or period (.). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the top-level domain (TLD) part of the email address.

Character classes provide a way to specify a set of allowed characters, making it easier to define patterns with specific requirements.
They allow you to match a single character from a range of choices.



### Flags
Flags, also known as modifiers or options, are special characters or settings in regular expressions that modify the behavior of the pattern matching.
They are appended after the closing delimiter of a regex pattern and help control aspects such as case sensitivity, global matching, and multiline matching.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), there are no flags specified. \
However, let's discuss some commonly used flags:

i (case-insensitive): This flag makes the pattern case-insensitive, allowing it to match both uppercase and lowercase letters without distinction. \
For example, /pattern/i would match "apple", "Apple", or "APPLE" interchangeably.

g (global): This flag enables global matching, meaning that the pattern will search for all occurrences of the pattern within the text rather than stopping at the first match. \
For example, /pattern/g would find and match all instances of "pattern" in the given text.

m (multiline): This flag enables multiline matching, allowing the start (^) and end ($) anchors to match the beginning and end of each line within a multiline text. \
Without this flag, these anchors would only match the start and end of the entire string.

Flags provide additional control over how a regular expression is interpreted and applied.
They help tailor the matching behavior to specific requirements and can greatly influence the results obtained from a regex pattern.



### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing are techniques in regular expressions that allow you to group parts of a pattern together and capture the matched text.
This is achieved by enclosing the desired pattern within parentheses ( ).

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), grouping and capturing are used to capture specific parts of the email address:

([a-z0-9_\.-]+) captures the username part of the email address. \
Any matching sequence of lowercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, or hyphens will be captured and can be referred to later in the regex or accessed programmatically.

([\da-z\.-]+) captures the domain name part of the email address. \
Any matching sequence of digits, lowercase letters, periods, or hyphens will be captured.

([a-z\.]{2,6}) captures the top-level domain (TLD) part of the email address. \
It captures a sequence of lowercase letters or periods with a length between 2 and 6 characters.

Grouping and capturing are useful for several reasons, including:

Applying quantifiers to a group as a whole, such as (abc)+ to match one or more occurrences of "abc".\
Extracting specific parts of a matched pattern for further processing or analysis.\
Referencing captured groups in replacement patterns for find-and-replace operations.\
Grouping and capturing enhance the flexibility and functionality of regular expressions, allowing you to work with specific portions of the matched text.



### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character classes or character sets, allow you to specify a set of characters from which a match can be made at a specific position in a regular expression.
They are enclosed within square brackets [ ] and define a range or a list of valid characters to match.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), bracket expressions are used to define the valid characters in different parts of the email address:

[a-z0-9_\.-] matches any lowercase letter (a-z), digit (0-9), underscore (_), period (.), or hyphen (-). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the username part of the email address.

[\da-z\.-] matches any digit (\d), lowercase letter (a-z), period (.), or hyphen (-). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the domain name part of the email address.

[a-z\.] matches any lowercase letter (a-z) or period (.). \
This character class is used to define valid characters in the top-level domain (TLD) part of the email address.

Bracket expressions provide a concise way to define a range or a list of characters that can match at a particular position.
They allow you to specify valid options for matching, which is useful in cases where the expected characters are limited or have a specific pattern.



### Greedy and Lazy Match
In regular expressions, matching behavior can be either greedy or lazy, affecting how patterns match and capture text.
Greedy matching attempts to match as much text as possible, while lazy (also known as non-greedy or reluctant) matching attempts to match as little text as possible.
By default, regular expressions use greedy matching.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), the matching behavior is greedy, meaning that quantifiers like + and {2,6} will match as much text as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.

However, it's worth noting that the concept of greediness or laziness mainly applies to quantifiers, such as +, *, and {}, that control the repetition of preceding elements. \
By adding a ? after a quantifier, you can make it lazy. For example, +? or *? would make the quantifier match as little text as possible.

Lazy matching is helpful when you want to match the smallest possible substring that satisfies the pattern.
It can be particularly useful when dealing with text that contains multiple occurrences of a pattern and you want to extract the shortest matching substring.



### Boundaries
Boundaries in regular expressions define specific positions in the text where matches should occur. 
They don't match any characters themselves but rather represent the positions between characters. 
Boundaries are useful for enforcing patterns to occur at specific locations within the text.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), boundaries are not explicitly used. 
However, let's explore two commonly used boundaries:

\b (word boundary): The word boundary represents the position between a word character (\w) and a non-word character (\W). \
It can be used to match patterns only at the beginning or end of words. For example, \btest\b would match the word "test" but not "atest" or "testy".

^ (caret) and $ (dollar sign): These anchors represent the start and end of a line or string, respectively.
They ensure that the regex pattern matches from the beginning (^) and ends ($) of the text.

By using both anchors together (^pattern$), the entire string must match the pattern without any extraneous characters.

Boundaries help enforce specific positioning requirements in regular expressions, allowing you to match patterns only at the desired locations within the text.



### Back-references
Back-references in regular expressions allow you to refer back to previously matched text and use it in the pattern. 
They are created by capturing groups (defined using parentheses) and can be referenced using backslash followed by the group number (\n) or by the syntax \k<name>, where n is the group number and name is the name assigned to the group.

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), back-references are not explicitly used. 
However, they are commonly used in scenarios where you need to match repeating patterns or ensure that the same text appears again later in the pattern.

For example, consider a regex pattern that matches repeated words:


```
\b(\w+)\b\s+\1\b
```
  
In this pattern, (\w+) captures a word, \s+ matches one or more whitespace characters, and \1 is a back-reference to the first captured group. 
This pattern would match repeated words such as "hello hello" or "apple apple".

Back-references allow you to create more sophisticated patterns that involve repetition and ensure consistency within the matched text.



### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions, also known as positive and negative assertions, are constructs in regular expressions that allow you to match patterns based on what comes ahead or behind the current position, without including the matched text in the overall match.
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are denoted by parentheses preceded by a specific syntax:

Positive look-ahead assertion: (?=...) matches the current position if it is followed by the specified pattern.\

Negative look-ahead assertion: (?!=...) matches the current position if it is not followed by the specified pattern.\

Positive look-behind assertion: (?<=...) matches the current position if it is preceded by the specified pattern.\

Negative look-behind assertion: (?<!...) matches the current position if it is not preceded by the specified pattern.\

In the given email regex (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/), look-ahead or look-behind assertions are not explicitly used. 
However, they are powerful tools for advanced pattern matching.
  
For example, you can use a positive look-ahead assertion to match a word only if it is followed by a specific pattern. Consider the following regex pattern:
```
\w+(?=ing)
```
This pattern matches any word that is followed by the suffix "ing" without including "ing" in the overall match. For instance, it would match "run" in "running", "jump" in "jumping", and so on.
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions provide additional flexibility and control in specifying patterns based on the context around them.
